# Bias-Free-Hatespeech-Detection

Deep Neural Network to detect Hate Speech from social media.

This is a major project (Monsoon-2018) for IRE (Information Retrival and Extraction) course.
The aim of this project is to propose novel idea for bias-free hatespeech detection. 

I will try to build two neural network based models for this purpose: LSTM and MLP.

**Phase1**
Models will try to just classify sentences as hate or non-hate.

**Phase2**
Models will try to just remove the bias factor (say gender or religion) and then do the classification.

Dataset used for this project contains ~24k tweets. 

I will keep adding more details.

P.S. *I am also a contributer to the project: github.com/schowdhury671/Bias-Free-Hatespeech-Detection. Both versions may or may not be same. However, this version will always be updated to the last commit made that I made there.*
