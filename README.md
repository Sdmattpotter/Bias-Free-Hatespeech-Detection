# Bias-Free-Hatespeech-Detection

Deep Neural Network to detect Hate Speech from social media.

This is a major project (Monsoon-2018) for IRE (Information Retrival and Extraction) course.
The aim of this project is to propose novel idea for bias-free hatespeech detection. 

I have tried to build two neural network model for this purpose: LSTM and MLP.
